Description:

The Music Application is a web-based platform that allows users to discover, listen to, and manage their favorite songs. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse through various song categories, upload new songs, and give feedback for songs they like. The application also supports user registration and authentication, allowing users to create accounts and access personalized features.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up for the application using their email and password. After registration, users can log in to their accounts securely.
Song Management: Authenticated users can upload new songs to the platform. Each song includes essential details such as the title, category, file path, description, and rating.
